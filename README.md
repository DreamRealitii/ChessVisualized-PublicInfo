# ChessVisualized-Public
Chess but you see where each piece can go. Available on Steam.

If you think there is something wrong with my game, go to Issues and click New Issue.
The code included here shows how I implemented the gameplay of Chess Visualized, not any of the UI or control that you would need to copy my game.
